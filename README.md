🖼️ About the Project
This is a personal website designed to showcase my artwork and Instagram posts in an organized gallery format.
The design is inspired by soft pastel tones and minimalist layouts, creating a calm and elegant space for art lovers and visitors.

Built with pure HTML and CSS, the site features a two-column grid layout for art posts, simple navigation, and a soft, brushstroke-themed background.
It's perfect for artists, creators, or anyone wanting to display a portfolio online with a light and modern aesthetic.
